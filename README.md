This project is a collection of utilities for Java Lambda functions. It is designed to be used with the [AWS Lambda Java runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/java-handler.html).

## Library

    <artifactId>utils-lambda-java</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## References
The [reference](reference) folder contains various reference files and code snippets used in Java-based lambda functions. These files are typically included here because their dependencies are too large or utility too narrow to include in the distributed library.
